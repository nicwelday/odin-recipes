<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Your classic alfredo possible! Our household favorite because it's quick, easy, and delicious. </p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>1 and 1/4 cups milk</li>
    <li>1.5 oz cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh parmesan (I prefer the big flakes that come in the plastic cup to blocks out shredded) </li>
    <li>1 box of penne noodles (or noodles of your choice)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Get all of your stuff measured and prepped before cooking or it will be impossible.</li>
    <li>Put your noodles on to boil </li>
    <li>Add butter and garlic in the sauce pot. Mix that on medium heat for about 2 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon of flour, mix for just a few seconds until it's thick and kind of pasty. </li>
    <li>Add in 1 and 1/4 cups milk, wisk continuously for 7 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add cream cheese, mix for 2 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add Parmesan and mix until thoroughly blended. </li>
    <li>You're done! If you're still waiting for other stuff to finish, leave it on low heat and stir occasionally to keep the sauce from clumping. </li>
</ol>
